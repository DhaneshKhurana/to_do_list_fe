Title: To-Do-List Front End Assignment

Summary:
Hi,
My name is Dhanesh Khurana. I have completed the frot-end development for to-do list. And It was very fun and 
learning journey as I got lots of error and I was able to suceessfully handle all.
Integerating front-end with backend was most chaleenging where I got most of the error. But It was a good learning
journey.
Adding delete functionlaity posed one main challenge as the ids had to be unique. So rather than 
generating ids using length of task stored and these are being generated using timestamp and mac address
using UniqId package.

/** Updates **/
-> Delete Icon has been added to task UI.
-> Now ids are genrated randomly and uniquely by using UniqId package.
-> Now task can be added by pressing enter key as well.

Technical Summary:
This assignment has mainly utilised 2 technlogoies. viz:
    i) React.js:
        To create the front-end in a modular way using components.
    ii) React-Bootstrap and Bootstrap:
        To style the front end.
    iii) UniqId:
        To generate unique ids.

P.S. : I have also attahed the screenshots of the app in screenshot folder.

Thankyou.
